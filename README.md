**What is Pineal XT?**
----------------------

**Pineal XT is marketed as a unique supplement designed to improve sleep quality, boost energy levels, and support overall bodily functions. What sets it apart is its focus on the health of the pineal gland.**

### **The Pineal Gland and Its Role in Health**

**The pineal gland, often referred to as the “third eye,” is a small endocrine gland in the brain responsible for producing melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. It’s also believed to influence energy levels, mood, and even spiritual awareness. Pineal XT claims to “supercharge” the pineal gland using a carefully crafted formula.**
